## 📦 Inventory System Logic (Auto)

1. If 10kg rice in stock & 20kg purchased → System auto-updates to **30kg**.
2. If Chef prepares 10kg Chicken Biryani → Based on SOP:

   * System auto-deducts quantity from inventory (e.g., 5kg rice)
3. No manual tracking needed for stock usage—**system calculates automatically from SOP**
4. **Inventory Alert:** Only visible to Kitchen Manager when stock falls below threshold

---
